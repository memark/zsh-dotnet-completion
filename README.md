> Zsh plugin for _dotnet_ CLI completion

![Short movie showing tab completion in Zsh for dotnet CLI](demo.gif)

This is basically just a wrapper for the instructions found at [How to enable TAB completion for the .NET Core CLI](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/core/tools/enable-tab-autocomplete#zsh) by Microsoft.

The structure of this repo was inspired by [zsh-better-npm-completion](https://github.com/lukechilds/zsh-better-npm-completion) by Luke Childs, from which I also copied all the installation instructions.
